Impact of COVID-19 on Indian Foreign Exchange Earnings - A Time Series Analysis.

Introduction:
The foreign exchange market, often referred to as the Forex, is a market where one currency is traded against another currency. With the increasing globalization of the world economy and the international character of the commodity market, FX trading activity is continuously increasing.
This exchange is essential in commodity trade, due to the international nature of the currency market. The foreign exchange is however also a market on itself, where speculative traders trade different currencies with the intention of making a profit on price fluctuations between currencies.


Motivation:
The importance of Forex Reserves for a nation cannot be counted in numbers.
The foremost advantage of Forex is in meeting the international finance obligations including sovereign and commercial debts, financing of imports. It helps in boosting the confidence of the market in ability of a country to meet its external obligations and also acts as cushion for unforeseen external shocks.
RBI uses the forex to adjust foreign exchange rates. And in the case of sharp fall in the foreign exchange value of the Rupee, RBI sells the Dollar which appreciates the Rupee.
Moreover, India’s Foreign Exchange Reserves contributed 15.419 % to the GDP in Mar 2020 which was recorded to increase from its previous value of 15.053% in December 2019.
